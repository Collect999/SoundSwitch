# SoundSwitchExperiments

This started out as a way of matching vocalisations in a really reliable way rather than just relying on amplitude 

We have a little app that listens to the mic and compares it to sound samples. So You need to get short, clean sound samples as wav files, put them in the sound-samples directory and run the system tray app.

It will then listen to the mic in the computer.
